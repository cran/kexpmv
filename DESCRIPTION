Description: Implements functions from 'EXPOKIT' 
			 (<https://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/>) to calculate 
			 matrix exponentials, Sidje RB, (1998) <doi:10.1145/285861.285868>. 
			 Includes functions for small dense matrices along with functions 
			 for large sparse matrices. The functions for large sparse matrices 
			 implement Krylov subspace methods which help minimise the 
			 computational complexity for matrix exponentials. 'Kexpmv' can be 
			 utilised to calculate both the matrix exponential in isolation 
			 along with the product of the matrix exponential and a vector.
